<h1>Hi, I'm Hiba! üëã</h1>
I am a highly motivated Cybersecurity professional with a passion for technology and building a more secure and innovative future. Leveraging experience in FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, and NIST RMF, I analyze client system architectures to identify security gaps across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.  I'm skilled in developing System Security Plans (SSPs) and Gap Analyses, and am currently expanding my expertise in Identity & Access Management (IAM) with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Windows AD, Okta, and Sailpoint IdentityIQ. I am always eager to learn and grow!
