<h1>Hi, I'm Hiba! 👋</h1>
I am a highly motivated student and IT professional with a passion for technology and cybersecurity. I have gained valuable experience through my internship as a Sys Admin Intern at Raytheon BBN Technologies and my participation in CTF competitions with Mason Competitive Cyber. I am also Security+ certified and am currently working toward getting Splunk certified. I am eager to learn, grow, and build a more secure and innovative future.
